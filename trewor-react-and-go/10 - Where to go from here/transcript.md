## 117 - React and Redux

One really popular project that is used with a lot of reactor applications is React Redux, which is

an official port or version of the Redux Library for React and Redux is nothing more than a predictable

state container for JavaScript applications.

And this is the website for reactor redux right here.

And the easiest way to look at this is to go to the get started.

And it is something you probably should be aware of.

It's something that a lot of people use.

It is a deep integration with react router, which we used in this course, but we didn't use this one

and we didn't use it for a very simple reason.

This is like so many other things, a shortcut.

And I think it's critical for people working in any technology reacted included to get a good firm grasp

of the fundamentals before they go to any of the adults.

And jumping straight to a shortcut, in my opinion, is just a recipe for disaster.

In any case, redux is a great little package and you can use it as it says right here.

You can create a redux in plain JavaScript template.

Just like this, NPCs create React app the name of your app and add the template redux.

And using it is as simple as on your root element.

You create a store and that store is something that will be shared with whatever components you want

to share it with.

And it's all handled by Redux and it works very well.

It is a little awkward the first couple of times you use it, but once you've done it once or twice,

it becomes straightforward and it is, I freely confess, something I almost never use, largely because,

as I'm sure you figured out by now, I'm something of a purist, but it's very popular and it's very

popular for good reason.

It works really, really well.

So it's something you might want to explore down the road.

And I just wanted you to be aware of it.

And if I have a follow up to this course, which right now I'm planning on doing, I'll probably use

this in some way, shape or form just because it is so popular and a lot of companies use it.
